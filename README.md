# Local MongoDB Replica Set deployment with docker-compose

Local setup MongoDB server with replication set using docker-compose

The MongoDB database connector uses transactions to support nested writes.
We get errors if we try to actually write to a database that does not have replication.

### You have two solutions:

1. Use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). It is a free-service where we can create MongoDB cluster that supports replication.
2. Setup a local MongoDB server with replication

## Tech Stack

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (docker-compose)
- YAML
- Bash
## Installation

Clone the project

```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:AlaeddineMessadi/Mongodb-Replica-Set-docker-compose.git mongodb-replset
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  $ cd mongodb-replset
```

Start the server

```bash
  $ ./start.sh
```
If you didn't use `./start.sh` script, then you should run `$ docker exec mongo1 /scripts/init.sh` after your run `$ docker-compose up -d` to initialize replica set in your servers.

Stop the server

```bash
  $ ./stop.sh

  # or

  $ docker-compose down
```

### If error shell scripts
```

```

### Run if replica set script error
```
docker exec mongo1 /scripts/init.sh
```
and restart mongo-express or run again `./start.sh`
